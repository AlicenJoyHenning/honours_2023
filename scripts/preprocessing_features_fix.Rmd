This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
install.packages("readr")
library(readr)

features <- read_tsv("features.tsv.gz")

# check names of columns : 
colnames(features)

# change the names of the headers : 
colnames(features) <- c("ENSG", "GGNC")

# check if it worked :  
colnames(features)

# if else statement to change those 'NA' values in the GGNC column with corresponding ENSG name 
features$GGNC <- ifelse(is.na(data$GGNC), data$ENSG, data$GGNC)

# save the updated version of the tsv file 

write_tsv(features, "updated_features.tsv.gz")

# check updated_features file : 
updated_features <- read_tsv("updated_features.tsv.gz")


# doing the opposite : 

features$HGNC <- ifelse(grepl("^ENSG", features$HGNC), NA, features$HGNC)

# back from the start to first remove the version number from the ensembl ID gene names before using them for the HGNC names : 

features <- substring(features$Ensembl_ID, 1, 15)


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
